Tutorial 0: Installing libCellML libraries
-----------------------------------------------


1. Create an empty folder and navigate into it

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir libcellml-tutorials
    cd libcellml-tutorials

2. Clone the branch from the libcellml github repository into the folder.
This will create and populate a folder called :code:`libcellml`.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone -b export_compiler_features_i428 --single-branch https://github.com/hsorby/libcellml.git
    git clone -b develop --single-branch https://github.com/cellml/libcellml.git

Your folder structure is now:

.. code-block:: text

    -- libcellml-tutorials
     +--libcellml
        +-- ... contains the files you cloned


3. Create two more folders inside your :code:`libcellml-tutorials` folder

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir build-library
    mkdir install-library

Your folder structure should now look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    -- libcellml-tutorials
     +--build-library
        +-- ... empty
     +--install-library
        +-- ... empty
     +--libcellml
        +-- ... contains the files you cloned


4. Navigate into the :code:`build-library` directory to make and install the
library:

.. code-block:: console

    cd build-library
    cmake -DINSTALL_PREFIX=../install-library ../libcellml
    make -j
    make install
    cd ..

You should see output similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

5. Change back into the top directory and download the tutorials from ??.

.. code-block:: console

    cd ../


Your folder should now look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    -- libcellml-tutorials
     +--build-library
        +-- ( ... lots of files from your earlier make command )
     +--install-library
        +-- include
        +-- lib
     +--libcellml
     +--test_installation
        +-- test_installation.cpp
        +-- CMakeLists.txt
     +--tutorial1
        +-- ( ... files for the tutorial )
     +--tutorial2
     + ( ... etc ... )

6. Change into the :code:`test_installation` folder and build the test example
to check your installation:

.. code-block:: console

    cd test_installation
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../install-library .
    make -j
    ./test_installation

If your installation is correct you will see an output similar to below, where
the number is the version of the libCellML library:

.. code-block:: console
