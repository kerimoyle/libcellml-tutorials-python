libCellML Python Tutorials
==========================

Welcome to the tutorials for libCellML.  These are arranged into three sections
as follows.  The first section (0-3) contains introductory tutorials which
demonstrate the functionality of the libCellML library on trivial applications.
The second section (4-8) are designed to be worked through in sequence, with
each one building on the previous tutorials towards re-creating the famous
Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model.  The final section is a reference section
containing stand-alone documentation for different parts of the library,
as well as background information on some of the models used here.

You will find a list of what you'll need to know at the start of each tutorial,
as well as what you can expect to learn.  Though each tutorial
builds on the one(s) before it, you can use these skills lists to jump in at
any point, and refer backwards to earlier ones if need be.  Most of the
tutorials generate resources for use in later tutorials, but you can retrieve
any which you haven't made yourself from the Resources folder provided.
There is skeleton code inside each directory to get you started, and completed
code inside the Completed folder for each tutorial too.
